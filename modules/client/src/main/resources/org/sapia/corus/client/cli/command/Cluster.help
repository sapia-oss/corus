   <p>Provides cluster-related functionality.</p>

  <section title="Syntax">
    <p>cluster status [[-cluster] [-seq]]</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>OR:</p>    
    <p>cluster check</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>OR:</p>    
    <p>cluster domain &lt;name&gt; [-cluster]</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>OR:</p>
    <p>cluster repo &lt;role&gt; [-cluster]</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>OR:</p>      
    <p>cluster resync [[-cluster] [-seq]]</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- status: displays the cluster status info.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- check: checks the status of each node in the cluster (attempts connecting to each one) and displays the corresponding information (the -cluster option does not apply).</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- domain: changes the name of the cluster to which the targeted nodes belong (these nodes will re-broadcast their presence, to the cluster whose name is given).</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- repo: changes the repository role of the targeted nodes (role must be either on of these strings: client, server, none).</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- resync : forces a resync of the current node with the other nodes in the cluster (this command does not support the -cluster option).</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>- cluster: if specified, the command will be replicated to all Corus servers in the cluster.</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>- seq: if the command is clustered, indicates that it should be done one host after the other from the client, sequentially (rather than through cascading replication).</p>
  </section>
  <section title="Notes">
    <p>The resync command does not support the -cluster option: the current node will broadcast an event to the broadcast channel automatically, 
    indicating to all nodes that they should republish themselves to be rediscovered.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>A resync is done somewhat as a last resort when observing desynchronization between nodes in the cluster (when some nodes have 
    disappeared from the cluster view of other nodes).</p>
